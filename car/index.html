This assignment is a modified version of the <a
  href="http://stanford.edu/~cpiech/cs221/homework/prog/driverlessCar/driverlessCar.html">Driverless
  Car</a> assignment written by Chris Piech.
</p>

<p>
A <a href="http://en.mercopress.com/2013/03/18/in-2010-there-were-1.24-million-road-traffic-related-deaths-worldwide-says-who-report">study</a>
by the World Health Organization found that road accidents kill a shocking 1.24
million people a year worldwide.
In response, there has been great interest in
developing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car">autonomous driving technology</a>
that can drive with calculated precision and reduce this death
toll.
Building an autonomous driving system is an incredibly complex endeavor.
In this assignment, you will focus on the sensing system, which allows
us to track other cars based on noisy sensor readings.
</p>

<p>
<b>Getting started.</b> You will be running two files in this assignment - grader.py and drive.py. The drive.py file is not used for any grading purposes, it's just there to visualize the code you will be writing and help you gain an appreciation for how different approaches result in different behaviors (and to have fun!).
Let's start by trying to drive manually.
<pre>python drive.py -l lombard -i none</pre>
<p>You can steer by either using the arrow keys or 'w', 'a', and 'd'.
The up key and 'w' accelerates your car forward, the left
key and 'a' turns the steering wheel to the left,
and the right key and 'd' turns the steering wheel to the right.
Note that you cannot reverse the car or turn in place.
 Quit by pressing 'q'.
Your goal is to drive from the start to finish (the green box) without getting
in an accident. How well can you do on the windy Lombard street without knowing
the location of other cars?  Don't worry if you're not very good; the teaching staff were
only able to get to the finish line 4/10 times.  An accident rate of 60%
is pretty abysmal, which is why we're going to use AI to do this. 
</p>

<p>Flags for <code>python drive.py</code>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>-a</code>: Enable autonomous driving (as opposed to manual).</li>
  <li><code>-i &lt;inference method&gt;</code>: Use <code>none</code>, <code>exactInference</code>, <code>particleFilter</code> to (approximately) compute the belief distributions over the locations of the other cars.</li>
  <li><code>-l &lt;map&gt;</code>: Use this map (e.g. <code>small</code> or <code>lombard</code>). Defaults to <code>small</code>.</li>
  <li><code>-d</code>: Debug by showing all the cars on the map.</li>
  <li><code>-p</code>: All other cars remain parked (so that they don't move).</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>
<h1>Modeling car locations</h1>
We assume that the world is a two-dimensional rectangular grid
on which your car and $K$ other cars reside.
At each time step $t$, your car gets a noisy estimate
of the distance to each of the cars.  As a simplifying assumption, we
assume that each of the $K$ other cars moves independently and
that the noise in sensor readings for each car is also independent.
Therefore, in the following, we will reason about each car independently
(notationally, we will assume there is just one other car).
</p>

<p>
At each time step $t$, let $C_t \in \mathbb R^2$
be a pair of coordinates representing the <i>actual</i> location of
the single other car (which is unobserved).
We assume there is a local conditional distribution $p(c_t \mid c_{t-1})$ which
governs the car's movement.
Let $a_t \in \mathbb R^2$ be your car's position,
which you observe and also control.
To minimize costs, we use a simple sensing system based on a microphone.
The microphone provides us with $D_t$,
which is a Gaussian random variable with mean equal
to the true distance between your car and the other car
and variance $\sigma^2$ (in the code, $\sigma$ is <code>Const.SONAR_STD</code>, which
is about two-thirds the length of a car).
In symbols, <center>$D_t \sim \mathcal N(\|a_t - C_t\|_2, \sigma^2)$.</center></p>

<p>
For example, if your car is at $a_t = (1,3)$ and the other car is
at $C_t = (4,7)$, then the actual distance is $5$ and $D_t$ might be $4.6$ or $5.2$, etc.
Use <code>util.pdf(mean, std, value)</code> to compute the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function">probability density function (PDF)</a>
of a Gaussian with given mean <code>mean</code> and standard deviation <code>std</code>, evaluated at <code>value</code>.
Note that evaluating a PDF at a certain value does not return a probability -- densities can exceed $1$ --
but for the purposes of this assignment, you can get away with treating it like
a probability.
The Gaussian probability density function for the noisy distance
observation $D_t$, which is centered around your distance to the car $\mu =
\|a_t - C_t\|_2$, is shown in the following figure:</p>
<center> <img style="height:200px" src="pdf.png"> </center>

<p>
Your job is to implement a car tracker that (approximately) computes the posterior
distribution $\mathbb P(C_t \mid D_1 = d_1, \dots, D_t = d_t)$
(your beliefs of where the other
car is) and update it for each $t = 1, 2, \dots$.  We will take care
of using this information to actually drive the car (i.e., set $a_t$ to avoid a
collision with $c_t$), so you don't have to worry about that part.
</p>

<p>
To simplify things, we will discretize the world into <b>tiles</b>
represented by <code>(row, col)</code> pairs,
where <code>0 &lt;= row &lt; numRows</code>
and <code>0 &lt;= col &lt; numCols</code>.
For each tile, we store a probability representing our belief that there's a car on that tile.
The values can be accessed by:
<code>self.belief.getProb(row, col)</code>.
To convert from a tile to a location,
use <code>util.rowToY(row)</code> and <code>util.colToX(col)</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Here's an overview of the assignment components:
  </p>
<ul>
<li>In Problems 1 and 2 (code), you will implement <code>ExactInference</code>,
  which computes a full probability distribution of another car's location over
  tiles <code>(row, col)</code>.</li>
<li>In Problem 3 (code), you will implement <code>ParticleFilter</code>,
  which works with particle-based representation of this same distribution.</li>
  <li>Problem 4 (written) gives you a chance to extend your probability analyses
    to a slightly more realistic scenario where there are multiple other cars and
    we can't automatically distinguish between them.</li>
  </ul>


<p>
  <b>A few important notes before we get started: </b>
  </p>
<ul>
<li>Past experience suggests that this will be one of the most conceptually
  challenging assignments of the quarter for many students.  Please start early,
  especially if you're low on late days!</li>
<li>We strongly recommend that you attend/watch the lectures on Bayesian networks and HMMs before getting started,
  and keep the slides handy for reference while you're working.</li>
<li>The code portions of this assignment are short and straightforward -- no more than about 30 lines in total --
  but only if your understanding of the probability concepts is clear!  (If not, see the previous point.) </li>
<li>As a notational reminder: we use the lowercase expressions $p(x)$ or $p(x|y)$ for local conditional
  probability distributions, which are defined by the Bayesian network.  We use the uppercase expressions
  $\mathbb P(X = x)$ or $\mathbb P(X = x | Y = y)$ for joint and posterior probability distributions,
  which are not pre-defined in the Bayesian network but can be computed by probabilistic inference.
  Please review the lecture slides for more details.
</li>
</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<h2 class="problemTitle">Problem 1: Emission probabilities</h2>

<p>
In this problem, we assume that the other car is stationary (e.g., $C_t =
C_{t-1}$ for all time steps $t$).
You will implement a function <code>observe</code> that upon observing a new
distance measurement $D_t = d_t$ updates the current posterior probability from
$$\mathbb P(C_t \mid D_1 = d_1, \dots, D_{t-1} = d_{t-1})$$
to
$$\mathbb P(C_t \mid D_1 = d_1, \dots, D_t = d_t) \propto \mathbb P(C_t \mid D_1 = d_1, \dots, D_{t-1} = d_{t-1}) p(d_t \mid c_t),$$
where we have multiplied in the emission probabilities $p(d_t \mid c_t)$ described earlier under "Modeling car locations".
The current posterior probability is stored as <code>self.belief</code> in <code>ExactInference</code>.
</p>

<center> <img style="width:300px" src="emission.png"> </center>

<ol class="problem">
<li class="code" id="1a">
Fill in the <code>observe</code> method in
the <code>ExactInference</code> class of <code>submission.py</code>.
This method should modify <code>self.belief</code> in place to update the posterior
  probability of each tile given the observed noisy distance to the other car.
After you're done, you should be able to find the stationary
car by driving around it (using the flag <code>-p</code> means cars don't move):</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
Once you implement the observe function, you can start driving with exact inference.
<pre>python drive.py -a -p -d -k 1 -i exactInference</pre>
You can also turn off <code>-a</code> to drive manually.
<li>Read through the code in util.py for the <code>Belief</code> class before you get started...
  you'll need to use this class for several of the code tasks in this assignment.</li>
<li>
Remember to normalize the posterior probability after you update it.
  (There's a useful function for this in util.py).
<li>
On the small map, the autonomous driver will sometimes drive in circles around the middle block before
  heading for the target area. In general, don't worry too much about the precise path the car takes.
  Instead, focus on whether your car tracker correctly infers the location of other cars.
<li>Don't worry if your car crashes once in a while! Accidents do happen, whether you are human or AI.
  However, even if there was an accident, your driver should have been aware that there was a high
  probability that another car was in the area.
</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<h2 class="problemTitle">Problem 2: Transition probabilities</h2>

<p>Now, let's consider the case where the other car is moving
according to transition probabilities $p(c_{t+1} \mid c_t)$.
We have provided the transition probabilities for you in <code>self.transProb</code>.
Specifically,
<code>self.transProb[(oldTile, newTile)]</code> is the probability of the other car
being in <code>newTile</code> at time step $t+1$ given that it was in <code>oldTile</code> at time step $t$.
</p>

<p>
In this part, you will implement a function <code>elapseTime</code> that updates
the conditional probability about the location of the car at a <b>current</b> time $t$
$$p(C_t = c_t \mid D_1 = d_1, \dots, D_t = d_t)$$
to the <b>next</b> time step $t+1$ conditioned on the same evidence, via the recurrence:
$$p(C_{t+1} = c_{t+1} \mid D_1 = d_1, \dots, D_t = d_t) \propto \sum_{c_t} p(C_t = c_t \mid D_1 = d_1, \dots, D_t = d_t) p(c_{t+1} \mid c_t).$$

Again, the posterior probability is stored as <code>self.belief</code> in <code>ExactInference</code>.
</p>

<ol class="problem">
<li class="code" id="2a">
Finish <code>ExactInference</code> by implementing the
<code>elapseTime</code> method.
When you are all done, you should be able to
track a moving car well enough to drive autonomously by running the following.</li>
<pre>python drive.py -a -d -k 1 -i exactInference</pre>
</ol>

<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>You can also drive autonomously in the presence of more than one car:
<pre>python drive.py -a -d -k 3 -i exactInference</pre>
  <li>You can also drive down Lombard:
<pre>python drive.py -a -d -k 3 -i exactInference -l lombard</pre>
On Lombard, the autonomous driver may attempt to drive up and down the street before heading towards the target area. Again, focus on the car tracking component, instead of the actual driving.
</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<h2 class="problemTitle">Problem 3: Particle filtering</h2>

<p>
Though exact inference works well for the small maps, it wastes a lot of effort
computing probabilities for <i>every available tile</i>, even for tiles that are unlikely
  to have a car on them.  We can solve this problem using a particle filter.
  Updates to the particle filter have complexity that's linear in the number of
  particles, rather than linear in the number of tiles.</p>

<p> 
For a great conceptual explanation of how particle filtering works, check out <a
  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUkBa1zMKv4">this video</a> on using particle filtering to estimate an airplane's altitude. 
</p>  
<p>
In this problem, you'll implement two short but important methods for the <code>ParticleFilter</code>
class in <code>submission.py</code>. When you're finished, your code should be able to track cars nearly
  as effectively as it does with exact inference. 
</p>

<ol class="problem">
<li class="code" id="3a">
Some of the code has been provided for you. For example, the particles have already been initialized
  randomly. You need to fill in the <code>observe</code> and <code>elapseTime</code> functions.
  These should modify <code>self.particles</code>, which is a map from tiles <code>(row, col)</code> to the
  number of particles existing at that tile, and <code>self.belief</code>, which needs to be updated each time
  you re-sample the particle locations.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
You should use the same transition probabilities as in exact inference.
The belief distribution generated by a particle filter is expected to look
noisier compared to the one obtained by exact inference.
<pre>python drive.py -a -i particleFilter -l lombard</pre>
To debug, you might want to start with the parked car flag
(<code>-p</code>) and the display car flag (<code>-d</code>).
</p>

<p>
Note: The random number generator inside util.weightedRandomChoice behaves differently
on different systems' versions of Python (e.g., Unix and Windows versions of Python). We ask that you run the code locally using Python 3.7 for consistency with the autograder.
<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<h2 class="problemTitle">Problem 4: Which car is it?</h2>

<p>
So far, we have assumed that we have a distinct noisy distance reading for each car, but in
reality, our microphone would just pick up an undistinguished set of these signals, and we
wouldn't know which distance reading corresponds to which car.
First, let's extend the notation from before: let $C_{ti} \in \mathbb R^2$ be the location
of the $i$-th car at the time step $t$, for $i = 1, \dots, K$ and $t = 1, \dots, T$.
Recall that all the cars move independently according to the transition dynamics as before.
</p>
<p>
Let $D_{ti} \in \mathbb R$ be the noisy distance measurement of the $i$-th car at time step $t$,
which is now not directly observed.
Instead, we observe the unordered <b>set</b> of distances
$\{ D_{t1}, \dots, D_{tK} \}$ as a collective and so cannot attribute any individual measurement in this set to a specific car.  (For simplicity, we'll assume that all distances are distinct values.)
In other words, you can think of this scenario as the same as observing the list $\mathbf{E_t} = [E_{t1}, \dots, E_{tK}]$
which is a <b>uniformly random </b> permutation of the (noisy) correctly ordered distances $\mathbf{D_t} = [D_{t1}, \dots, D_{tK}]$ where index $i$ represents the noisy distance to car $i$ at time $t$.
</p>

<p>
For example, suppose $K=2$ and $T = 2$.
Before, we might have gotten distance readings of $8$ and $4$ for the first car and
$5$ and $7$ for the second car at time steps $1$ and $2$, respectively.
Now, our sensor readings would be permutations of $\{8, 5\}$ (at time step $1$) and $\{4, 7\}$ (at time step $2$).
Thus, even if we knew the second car was distance $5$ away at time $t = 1$,
we wouldn't know if it moved further away (to distance $7$) or closer (to distance $4$) at time $t = 2$.
</p>

<center>
    <img style="height:250px" src="Q4_diag.jpeg">
</center>

      <p>Here is a diagram that shows the flow of information corresponding to the above situation for the case where $K = 2$ and only showing
      two timesteps, $t$ and $t+1$. Note that because the observed distances $\mathbf{E_t}$ are a permutation of the true distances $\mathbf{D_t}$,
      each $E_{ti}$ depends on all of the $D_{ti}$. Also note that the above diagram is not a Bayes net as
      $E_{t1}$ and $E_{t2}$ are not conditionally independent given $D_{t1}$ and $D_{t2}$ (however,
      $D_{t1}$ and $D_{t2}$ are conditionally independent given $C_{t1}$ and $C_{t2}$)</p>

<ol class="problem">
    <li class="writeup" id="4a">
    Suppose we have $K=2$ cars and one time step $T=1$.
    Write an expression for the conditional probability
    $p(C_{11} = c_{11}, C_{12} = c_{12} \mid \mathbf{E_1} = \mathbf{e_1})$
    as a function of the PDF of a Gaussian $\mathcal p_{\mathcal N}(v; \mu, \sigma^2)$
    and the prior probability $p(c_{11})$ and $p(c_{12})$ over car locations.
    Your final answer should not contain variables $D_{11}$, $D_{12}$.
    <p>
    Remember that $\mathcal p_{\mathcal N}(v; \mu, \sigma^2)$ is the probability of a random
    variable, $v$, in a Gaussian distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$.
    </p>
    <p>
    <i>Hint:</i> for $K=1$, the answer would be

    $$p(C_{11} = c_{11} \mid \mathbf{E_1} = \mathbf{e_1}) \propto p(c_{11}) p_{\mathcal N}(e_{11}; \|a_1 - c_{11}\|_2, \sigma^2).$$
    where $a_t$ is the position of your car (that you are controlling) at time $t$.
    Remember that $C_{ti}$ is the position of the $i$th observed car at time $t$. 
    To better inform your use of Bayes' rule, you may find it useful to draw the Bayesian network and think about the distribution of $\mathbf{E_t}$

        Note that $E_{t1}$ is the emission from one of the cars at timestep $t$, but we aren't sure which one (it is NOT necessarily car 1, it could be any of the cars).
        On the other hand, $D_{t1}$ is the measured distance of car 1 (we know with certainty that it comes from car 1), the only issue is that we don't observe it directly. </p>

      the technology and despite the researcher considering this secondary use unethical. Would the researcher
      be partially morally responsible for  improvements to the lethal use of the technology that result from
      their discoveries?  If not, give one reason why not. If so, explain why they are partially responsible and
      explain what action(s) the researcher should take to address this (choosing another line of research,
      building a safeguard, or other)?
