    What courses should you take in a given quarter?  Answering this question
    requires balancing your interests, satisfying prerequisite chains, graduation
    requirements, availability of courses; this can be a complex tedious process.
    In this assignment, you will write a program that does automatic course
    scheduling for you based on your preferences and constraints.
    The program will cast the course scheduling problem (CSP) as a constraint
    satisfaction problem (CSP) and then use backtracking search to solve that CSP
    to give you your optimal course schedule.
</p>

<p>
    You will first get yourself familiar with the basics of CSPs in Problem 0.
    In Problem 1, you will implement a heuristic you learned from 
    lecture that will make CSP solving much faster.
    Lastly, in Problem 2, you will create the course scheduling CSP
    and solve it using the code from previous parts.

<h2 class="problemTitle">Problem 0: CSP basics</h2>
<ol class="problem">

    <li class="writeup" id="0a">
        Let's create a CSP.
        Suppose you have $n$ light bulbs, where each light bulb $i = 1, \dots, n$ is initially off.
        You also have $m$ buttons which control the lights.
        For each button $j = 1, \dots, m$, we know the subset $T_j \subseteq \{ 1, \dots,
        n \}$ of light bulbs that it controls.
        When button $j$ is pressed, it toggles the state of each light bulb in $T_j$
        (for example, if $3 \in T_j$ and light bulb 3 is off, then after the button is pressed,
        light bulb 3 will be on, and vice versa). If multiple buttons—say $Z$ buttons—controlling
        the same light bulb are pressed, then that light bulb will be turned on if $Z$ is odd,
        or it will be turned off if $Z$ is even.
        <p>
            Your goal is to turn on all the light bulbs by pressing a subset of the buttons.
            Construct a CSP to solve this problem.
            Your CSP should have $m$ variables and $n$ constraints.
            <em>For this problem only</em>, you can use $m$-ary constraints:
            constraints that can be functions of up to $m$ variables.
            Describe your CSP precisely and concisely.
            You need to specify the variables with their domain,
            and the constraints with their scope and expression.
            Make sure to include $T_j$ in your answer.
            <br><br>
            Hint: If stuck, take a look at parts (b) and (c) of this problem to see how
            you could define the constraints using a boolean operator.

        Now, let's consider a simple CSP with 3 variables and 2 binary factors:
        <p>
            <img src="0-a.png" alt="0a - fancy CSP" />
        </p>
        where $X_1,X_2,X_3 \in \{0,1\}$ and $t_1, t_2$ are
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or">XOR</a>
        functions (that is $t_1(X) = x_1 \bigoplus x_2$ and $t_2(X) = x_2 \bigoplus x_3$).

        <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
            <li>
                What are the consistent assignments for this CSP?
            </li>
            <li>
                Let's use backtracking search to solve the CSP
                <em>without using any heuristics(MCV, LCV, forward checking, AC-3)</em>.
                The <code>Backtrack()</code> algorithm as defined in the lectures is a recursive algorithm,
                where new instances of  <code>Backtrack()</code> are called within parent instances of
                <code>Backtrack()</code>.

                <p>
                    In this problem, we will ask you to produce the <em>call stack</em> for a specific call to <code>Backtrack()</code>.
                    A call stack is just a diagram tracing out every recursive call. For our purposes, 
                    for each call to <code>Backtrack()</code> you should specify which variable is being assigned,
                    the current domains, and which parent call to <code>Backtrack()</code> it's called within. For example,
                    if the order in which we assign variables is $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$, the call stack would be as follows:
                    <table cellspacing="<strong>0</strong>">
                        <tr>
                            <td>{[01], [01], [01]}</td> <td>$\xrightarrow{X_1=0}$</td>
                            <td>{<strong>0</strong>, [01], [01]}</td>
                            <td>$\xrightarrow{X_2=1}$</td>
                            <td>{<strong>0</strong>, <strong>1</strong>, [01]}</td>
                            <td>$\xrightarrow{X_3=0}$</td>
                            <td class="consistent">{<strong>0</strong>, <strong>1</strong>, <strong>0</strong>}</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td></td>
                            <td>$\xrightarrow{X_1=1}$</td>
                            <td>{<strong>1</strong>, [01], [01]}</td>
                            <td>$\xrightarrow{X_2=0}$</td>
                            <td>{<strong>1</strong>, <strong>0</strong>, [01]}</td>
                            <td>$\xrightarrow{X_3=1}$</td>
                            <td class="consistent">{<strong>1</strong>, <strong>0</strong>, <strong>1</strong>}</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                <p>
                    The notation <td>{<strong>1</strong>, [01], [01]}</td> means that $X_1$ has been assigned value 1,
                    while $X_2$ and $X_3$ are currently unassigned and each have domain $\{0,1\}$.
                    Note that we omit the comma in the domain for easier reading. We also avoid the
                    weight variable for simplicity; the only possible weights for this problem are 0 and 1.
                    In this case, backtrack is called 7 times. Notice that <code>Backtrack()</code> is not called 
                    when there's an inconsistent partial assignment ($\delta=0$); for example, we don't call 
                    <code>Backtrack()</code> on $X_2 = 1$ when $X_1$ is already set to 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using this call stack, we can produce the list of calls in the order they are explored.
                    For this example where we assign variables in order $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$, the list would be
                    $\{[01], [01], [01]\}, \{0, [01], [01]\}, \{0, 1, [01]\}, \{0, 1, 0\}, 
                    \{1, [01], [01]\}, \{1, 0, [01]\}, \{1, 0, 1\}$.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suppose we assign variables in the order $X_3$, $X_1$, $X_2$.
                    Write the list of calls in the order they are explored and draw out the call-stack.
                    How many calls do we make to <code>Backtrack()</code>? Why can this number change depending on the ordering?
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                We often add heuristics like AC-3 to speed up the backtracking search. How many calls 
                to <code>Backtrack()</code> from your call stack in the previous question would we skip 
                if we use AC-3? Briefly explain why we skip (or don't skip) calls in this search with AC-3.

        $X_i \in \{0,1\}$ and $t_i(X) = x_i \bigoplus x_{i+1}$.
        Note that the CSP has a chain structure. Implement <code>create_chain_csp()</code> by

            <strong>Note</strong>: We've provided you with a CSP implementation
            in <code>util.py</code> which supports unary and binary factors. For
            now, you don't need to understand the implementation, but please read the
            comments and get yourself familiar with the CSP interface. For this

<!--
    Problem 1
-->
<h2 class="problemTitle">Problem 1: CSP solving</h2>

<p>
    We'll now pivot towards creating more complicated CSPs, and solving them faster using heuristics.
    Notice we are already able to solve the CSPs because in <code>submission.py</code>,
    a basic backtracking search is already implemented. For this problem, 
    we will work with <em>unweighted CSPs</em> that can only have True/False factors;
    a factor outputs 1 if a constraint is satisfied and 0 otherwise.
    The backtracking search operates over partial assignments, and specifies whether
    or not the current assignment satisfies all relevant constraints.
    When we assign a value to a new variable $X_i$, we check that all constraints
    that depend only on $X_i$ and the previously assigned variables are satisfied.
    The function <code>satisfies_constraints()</code> returns whether or not 
    these new factors are satisfied based on the <code>unaryFactors</code> 
    and <code>binaryFactors</code>.
    When <code>satisfies_constraints()</code> returns <code>False</code>, any full assignment that extends 
    the new partial assignment cannot satisfy all of the constraints,
    so <i>there is no need to search further with that new partial assignment</i>.
</p>

<p>
    Take a look at <code>BacktrackingSearch.reset_results()</code> to see the other fields
    which are set as a result of solving the weighted CSP.
    You should read <code>submission.BacktrackingSearch</code> carefully to make
    sure that you understand how the backtracking search is working on the CSP.
</p>

<ol class="problem">

    <li class="code" id="1a">
        Let's create an unweighted CSP to solve the n-queens problem:
        Given an $n\times n$ board, we'd like to
        place $n$ queens on this board such that no two queens are on the same row,
        column, or diagonal. Implement <code>create_nqueens_csp()</code> by <strong>
        adding $n$ variables</strong> and some number of binary factors.
        Note that the solver collects some basic
        statistics on the performance of the algorithm. You should take advantage of
        these statistics for debugging and analysis.
        You should get 92 (optimal) assignments for
        $n=8$ with exactly 2057 operations (number of calls to <code>backtrack()</code>).
        <p class="hint">
            Hint: If you get a larger number of operations or your code times out on the test cases,
            make sure your CSP is minimal.
            Try to define the variables such that the size of domain is O(n).
        </p>
        <p class="hint">
            Note: Please implement the domain of variables as 'list' type in Python.
            You can refer to <code>create_map_coloring_csp()</code> and <code>create_weighted_csp()</code>
            in <code>util.py</code> as examples of CSP problem implementations.
            You can try these examples out by running:

        You might notice that our search algorithm explores quite a large number of states
        even for the $8\times 8$ board. Let's see if we can do better.
        One heuristic we discussed in class is using most constrained variable (MCV):
        To choose an unassigned variable, pick
        the $X_j$ that has the fewest number of values $a$ which are consistent with the
        current partial assignment ($a$ for which <code>satisfies_constraints()</code> on
        $X_j=a$ returns <code>True</code>).

        Implement this heuristic in <code>get_unassigned_variable()</code> under the condition
        <code>self.mcv = True</code>. It should take you exactly 1361 operations to find all
        optimal assignments for 8 queens CSP &mdash; that's 30% fewer!

<!--
    Problem 2
-->
<h2 class="problemTitle">Problem 2: Course Scheduling</h2>

<p>
    In this problem, you will leverage our CSP solver for the problem of course scheduling.
    We have scraped a subset of courses that are offered from Stanford's
    Bulletin. For each course in this dataset,
    we have information on which quarters it is offered,
    the prerequisites (which may not be fully accurate due to
    ambiguity in the listing), and the range of units allowed.
    You can take a look at all the courses in <code>courses.json</code>.
    Please refer to
    <code>util.Course</code> and <code>util.CourseBulletin</code> for more information.
</p>

<p>
    To specify a desired course plan, you would need to provide a <i>profile</i>
    which specifies your constraints and preferences for courses.
    A profile is specified in a text file (see <code>profile*.txt</code> for examples).
    The profile file has four sections:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The first section specifies a fixed minimum and maximum
            (inclusive) number of units you need to take for each quarter.
            For example:
            <p>
                <pre>minUnits 0 <br>maxUnits 3</pre>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            In the second section, you <code>register</code> for the quarters that you want
            to take your courses in.  For example,
            <p>
                <pre>register Aut2019 <br>register Win2020 <br>register Spr2020</pre>
            </p>
            would sign you up for this academic year.
            The quarters need not be contiguous, but they must follow the
            exact format <code>XxxYYYY</code> where <code>Xxx</code> is one of <code>Aut, Win, Spr, Sum</code>
            and <code>YYYY</code> is the year.
        </li>
        <li>
            The third section specifies the list of courses that you've taken in the
            past and elsewhere using the <code>taken</code> keyword.
            For example, if you're in CS221, this is probably what you would put:
            <p>
                <pre>taken CS103 <br>taken CS106B <br>taken CS107 <br>taken CS109</pre>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            The last section is a list of courses that you would like to take during the registered quarters,
            specified using <code>request</code>.
            For example, two basic requests would look like this:
            <p>
                <pre>request CS224N <br>request CS229</pre>
            </p>
            Not every request must be fulfilled, and indeed, due to the additional constraints
            described below, it is possible that not all of them can actually be fulfilled.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Constrained requests.</b>
    To allow for more flexibility in your preferences,
    we allow some freedom to customize the requests:
    <ul>
        <li>
            You can request to take exclusively one of several
            courses by specifying:
            <p>
                <pre id="sample-request">request CS229 or CS229A or CS229T</pre>
            </p>
            Note that these courses do not necessarily have to be offered in the same
            quarter. The final schedule can have at most one of these three courses.
            <b>Each course can only be requested at most once.</b>
        </li>

        <li>
            If you want to take a course in one of a specified set of quarters, use the
            <code>in</code> modifier.
            For example, if you want to take one of CS221 or CS229 in either Aut2018 <b>or</b> Sum2019, do:
            <p>
                <pre>request CS221 or CS229 in Aut2018,Sum2019</pre>
            </p>
            If you do not specify any quarters, then the course can be taken in any quarter.
        </li>

        <li>
            Another operator you can apply is <code>after</code>, which specifies
            that a course must be taken after another one.
            For example, if you want to choose one of CS221 or CS229 and take it after
            both CS109 <b>and</b> CS161, add:
            <p>
                <pre>request CS221 or CS229 after CS109,CS161</pre>
            </p>
            Note that this implies that if you take CS221 or CS229, then you must take both CS109 and CS161.
            In this case, we say that CS109 and CS161 are <code>prereqs</code> of this request.
            (Note that there's <strong>no space</strong> after the comma.)
            <p>
                If you request
                course A and B (separately), and A is an official prerequisite of B based on
                the <code>CourseBulletin</code>,
                we will automatically add A as a prerequisite for B; that is,
                typing <code>request B</code> is equivalent to <code>request B after A</code>.
                Additionally, if A is a prerequisite of B, in order to request B
                you must either request A or declare you've taken A before.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            Finally, the last operator you can add is <code>weight</code>, which adds
            non-negative weight to each request. 
            To accommodate this, we will work with a standard CSP (as opposed to unweighted, like
            Problem 1), which associates a weight for
            each assignment $x$ based on the product of $m$ factor functions $f_1, \dots, f_m$:
            $$\text{Weight}(x) = \prod^m_{j=1}f_j(x)$$
            where each factor $f_j(x)\geq 0$.
            Our goal is to find the assignment(s) $x$ with the <strong>highest</strong> weight.
            Notice that our backtracking search already works with normal CSPs; you should
            simply define factors that output real numbers.
            For CSP construction, you can refer to the CSP examples we have provided
            in <code>util.py</code> for guidance (<code>create_map_coloring_csp()</code> and
            <code>create_weighted_csp()</code>).
            <p>
                All requests have a default weight value of 1.
                Requests with higher weight should be preferred by your
                CSP solver. Note that you can combine all of the aforementioned operators into
                one as follows (again, no space after comma):
                <p>
                    <pre id="sample-request">request CS221 or CS229 in Win2018,Win2019 after CS131 weight 5</pre>
                </p>
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Each <code>request</code> line in your profile is represented in code
    as an instance of the <code>Request</code> class (see <code>util.py</code>).
    For example, the request above would have the following fields:
    <ul>
        <li><code>cids</code> (course IDs that you're choosing one of) with value <code>['CS221', 'CS229']</code></li>
        <li><code>quarters</code> (that you're allowed to take the courses) with value <code>['Win2018', 'Win2019']</code></li>
        <li><code>prereqs</code> (course IDs that you must take before) with value <code>['CS131']</code></li>
        <li><code>weight</code> (preference) with value <code>5.0</code></li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    It's important to note that a request does not have to be fulfilled, <em>but if it is</em>,
    the constraints specified by the various operators <code>after,in</code> must
    also be satisfied.
</p>

<p>
    You shall not worry about parsing the profiles because
    we have done all the parsing of the bulletin and profile for you,
    so all you need to work with is the collection of <code>Request</code>
    objects in <code>Profile</code> and <code>CourseBulletin</code>
    to know when courses are offered and the number of units of courses.
</p>

Well, that's a lot of information! Let's open a python shell and see them in action:

<pre>
import util
# load bulletin
bulletin = util.CourseBulletin('courses.json')
# retrieve information of CS221
cs221 = bulletin.courses['CS221']
print(cs221)
# look at various properties of the course
print(cs221.cid)
print(cs221.minUnits)
print(cs221.maxUnits)
print(cs221.prereqs)  # the prerequisites
print(cs221.is_offered_in('Aut2018'))
print(cs221.is_offered_in('Win2019'))

# load profile from profile_example.txt
profile = util.Profile(bulletin, 'profile_example.txt')
# see what it's about
profile.print_info()
# iterate over the requests and print out the properties
for request in profile.requests:
    print(request.cids, request.quarters, request.prereqs, request.weight)
</pre>

<p>
    <b>Solving the CSP.</b>
    Your task is to take a profile and bulletin and construct a CSP.
    We have started you off with code in <code>SchedulingCSPConstructor</code>
    that constructs the core variables of the CSP as well as some basic constraints.
    The variables are all pairs of requests and registered quarters <code>(request, quarter)</code>,
    and the value of such a variable is one of the course IDs in that Request
    or <code>None</code>, which indicates none of the courses should be taken in that
    quarter. We will add auxiliary variables later.
    We have also implemented some basic constraints:
    <code>add_bulletin_constraints()</code>, which enforces that a course can only be
    taken if it's offered in that quarter (according to the bulletin), and
    <code>add_norepeating_constraints()</code>,
    which constrains that no course can be taken more than once.</p>

    <p>
        You should take a look at <code>add_bulletin_constraints()</code> and
        <code>add_norepeating_constraints()</code> to get a basic understanding
        how the CSP for scheduling is represented. Nevertheless, we'll highlight
        some important details to make it easier for you to implement:
    </p>

    <ul class="alert">
        <li>
            The existing variables are tuples of <code>(request, quarter)</code>
            where <code>request</code> is a <code>Request</code> object
            (like <a href="#sample-request">the one shown above</a>)
            and <code>quarter</code> is a <code>str</code> representing a quarter
            (e.g. <code>'Aut2018'</code>). For detail please look at
            <code>SchedulingCSPConstructor.add_variables()</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            The domain for <code>quarter</code> is all possible quarters
            (<code>self.profile.quarters</code>, e.g. <code>['Win2016', 'Win2017']</code>).
        </li>
        <li>
            Given a course ID <code>cid</code>, you can get the corresponding
            <code>Course</code> object by <code>self.bulletin.courses[cid]</code>.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<ol class="problem">

    <li class="code" id="2a">
        Implement the function <code>add_quarter_constraints()</code> in <code>submission.py</code>.
        This is when your profile specifies which quarter(s) you want your requested courses to be taken in.
        This is not saying that one of the courses must be taken,
        <em>but if it is</em>, then it must be taken in any one of the specified quarters.
        Also note that this constraint will apply to all courses in that request.
    </li>
    <li class="code" id="2b">
        Let's now add the unit constraints in <code>add_unit_constraints()</code>.
        <ol>
            <li>
                In order for our solution extractor to
                obtain the number of units, for every course,
                you must add a variable <code>(courseId, quarter)</code>
                to the CSP taking on a value equal to the number of units being taken for that
                course during that quarter. When the course is not taken during that quarter,
                the unit should be 0.
            </li>
            <li>
                You must take into account the appropriate binary factor between <code>(request, quarter)</code>
                and <code>(courseId, quarter)</code> variables.
            </li>
            <li> 
                You must ensure that the sum of units per quarter for your schedule are within
                the min and max threshold, inclusive. 
                You should use the <code>create_sum_variable()</code> function we've implemented for you; 
                pay careful attention to the arguments.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="hint">
            Hint: If your code times out, your <code>maxSum</code> passed
            to <code>create_sum_variable()</code> might be too large.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <b>Note:</b> Each grader test only tests the function you are asked to implement.
        To test your CSP with multiple constraints you can add to the profile text file whichever
        constraints that you want to add and run <code>run_p2.py</code>. Here is an example with
        profile2b.txt as input:
        <pre>python run_p2.py profile2b.txt</pre>
        Running this command will print information that may be helpful for debugging, such as profile information,
        the number of optimal assignments found (along with their weight and the number of times
        <code>backtrack()</code> is called while solving the CSP), one full optimal assignment,
        and the resulting course schedule.
    </li>
    <li class="writeup" id="2c">
        Now try to use the course scheduler for any two quarters in the future (or
        more quarters if you wish, although this might lead to a slower search).
        Create your own <code>profile.txt</code> (take a look at some of the profile text files
        included in the assignment's main directory for inspiration) and then run the course scheduler:
        <pre>python run_p2.py profile.txt</pre>
        If the courses you wish to schedule are not listed in <code>courses.json</code>,
        feel free to add them in as you please! In addition, feel free to modify course
        details as well (e.g., you can change the list of quarters that a course is
        being offered in if it does not match the information on the current year's course calendar).
        You might want to turn on the appropriate heuristic flags to speed up the
        computation; in particular, <code>self.ac3 = True</code> applies the arc-consistency heuristic 
        that we implement for you, and you can use your own MCV implementation.
        Does it produce a reasonable course schedule?
        Please include your <code>profile.txt</code> and the best schedule in your writeup
        (you can just paste it into the pdf that you submit);
        we're curious how it worked out for you! Please include your schedule and the profile in the PDF;
        otherwise you will not receive credit.
        <div class="expected">
            The profile.txt file (pasted into the pdf with the solutions),
            the corresponding outputted schedule, and a brief discussion (1-2 sentences) on whether

<h2 class="problemTitle">Problem 3: Residency Hours Scheduling</h2>
<ol class="problem">

    <li class="writeup" id="3a">
        Many uses of constraint satisfaction in real-world scenarios involve assignment of
        resources to entities, like assigning packages to different trucks to optimize delivery.
        However, when the agents are people, the issue of fair division arises.
        In this question, you will consider the ethics of what constraints to remove in a CSP
        when the CSP is unsatisfiable.
        <p>
            Medical residents are often scheduled to work long shifts with insufficient rest,
            leading to exhaustion and burnout. This can negatively affect the residents and potentially
            lead to mistakes that also negatively affect the patients in their care <a href="#fn-1">[1]</a>.
            A hospital could use a constraint-satisfaction approach to try to create a work schedule
            that respects the “on-call night, day-off, rest period, and total work-hour regulations
            mandated by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, as well as the number
            of residents needed each hour given the demand (aka number of patients and
            procedures scheduled) <a href="#fn-2">[2]</a>.
            The constraints are:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    One day off every 7 days
                </li>
                <li>
                    Minimum 8 hour rest period between shifts
                </li>
                <li>
                    No more than 80 hours of work per week averaged over a 4 week period
                </li>
                <li>
                    At least 14 hours free of clinical work and education after 24 hours of in-house call
                </li>
                <li>
                    Number of residents needed each hour
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s assume for a given hospital that the constraints listed above were collectively
            <b>unsatisfiable</b> given the number of residents assigned to that hospital.
            However, its formulation as an unsatisfiable CSP depends on other factors remaining fixed, such as
            <ol type="A">
                <li>
                    The number of total residents
                </li>
                <li>
                    The work to be performed by residents as opposed to other staff
                </li>
                <li>
                    The budget available to hire residents or other staff
                </li>
            </ol>
            In this case, would you remove one of the numbered constraints 1-5 or
            advocate that the hospital administration change one of A-C to make the problem solveable?
            If so, explain which one and give a reason why.  
        </p>
        <div class="expected">
            In 2-4 sentences, you must explicitly state which numbered constraint or
            lettered factor you would change and justify your choice with a reason that
            explains why you chose that one.
        </div>
